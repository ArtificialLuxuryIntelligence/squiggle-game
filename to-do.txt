fixed undo button
brush size changer?
rotate button? (ctx.rotate(deg) .?)
finish line colour object/array
name (and change name) in local storage from home screens
routes and error handling
to stop empty squiggles from being submitted: submit handler
add event listeners to window load function after squiggle has loaded
?smoothing - use animation request frames
mobile only message for desktops/ sort out mouse handlers (cf. touch functions but perhaps some tweaks (i.e. single point on mousedown etc))
reflow issue (probably caused by resizing canvas based on innerWidth...)
border is clipped on iphone 5 for some reason
add visual feedback for chain (it feels unresponsive like this?)7
infinite scroll/lazy load - (see intersection observers)

general JS rewrite:
  modulalize (and use bundler webpack?)
  -> get stuff out of global namespace (create objects with methods and this.x etc)
